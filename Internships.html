            It all began with a dream about helping students reach their dreams.As we grew, we didn't just follow changes, we led them. 
             We were the first to help students from all backgrounds get good jobs, the first to teach Full Stack in our area, and the first to make learning online exciting and real. 
             We built a place where students can feel like they're already part of the working world while still learning. Our place is where new ideas meet hard work, and everyone gets a chance to shine. 
             But Kodnest is more than just a tech cpmpany. It's a family. We don't just teach; we're here to guide, to cheer you on, and to inspire.
             Every time one of our students gets a job, it's not"</summary></dd></details>

            <strong><em> 1: Getting the Groundwork Right :</em></strong><br>
            <pre>
           <div style="margin-left: 5px;">
            Environment Setup:    Imagine you're setting up a new kitchen.You've got to make sure you have all the necessary tools, right?
                                  That's what we're doing here with the Java Development Kit - getting everything ready for the cooking...err, coding to begin.
           
            Architecture of Java: This is like taking a sneak peek into the brain of Java. We're looking at how it's structured and functions - understanding  
                                  its blueprint.
            
            Data Types in Java:   Think of these as the building blocks. Just like Lego, we have different types of blocks
                                  (like integers, characters, and booleans) to store various data.
            
            Operators in Java:    Here's where we start playing with our Lego blocks. Operators are the tools that let you perform operations - like adding
                                  two numbers or checking if one is larger than the other.
            </div>
            </pre>
            <strong><em>Module 2: Mastering the Logic</em></strong><br>
            <pre>
            <div style="margin-left: 5px;">
            Conditional Control Constructs: These are your guideposts. They help control where your program goes, making decisions based on 
                                            conditions - like a GPS guiding you on the road.
            
            Looping Control Constructs:     Imagine a magic wand that could repeat your actions. That's what loops do, repeating the same block of
                                            code as many times as you want.
            
            Methods in Java:                Think of methods as little helpers. You give them a job, and they do it for you. It's like having a magic elf that
                                            does your chores!
            
            Arrays, Strings in Java:        These are different types of containers for storing and organizing your data - like having different types 
                                            of storage boxes for your different toys.
            
            Packages:                       Packages are like rooms in a house. They help keep your code organized so you don't end up with a messy pile of code...err,
                                            clothes.
            
            Time and Space:                 This isn't about the universe; it's about your code! Here, we focus on making your code efficient so it runs quickly and
                                            doesn't hog up all the memory.

           <strong><em>3: Diving Deeper into Java</em></strong><br>
           <pre>
           <div style="margin-left: 5px;">
            
            Objects & Classes, Encapsulation, Constructors, and Static Keyword: Here's where we start molding our Lego blocks into structures.
            We define our objects, encapsulate them, and get them ready for action.
            
            Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Interfaces: These are your secret weapons to write more flexible, robust, and easy-to-understand code.
            Like a Swiss army knife, these tools give your code the superpower of adaptability.
            
            Exceptions and Exception Handling: Code is like a recipe - sometimes, things go wrong. Exceptions are when your code says "Oops!", and handling 
                                               these exceptions is how you troubleshoot these hiccups.
            
            Multi-Threading:                   Who doesn't want to do multiple things at once? Multi-threading is like having many hands, each working on a different task 
                                               simultaneously.
            
            Collections and Generics:          Imagine having a magic bag that can store groups of objects. Collections and generics are like this magic bag but with 
                                               more powerful features!

           <div style="margin-left: 5px;">
            
            J2EE, Spring Boot Configuration: Welcome to the world of Spring - a playground full of tools that help you build complex applications. It's like 
            getting an upgrade from building with Lego to constructing skyscrapers.
            
            Spring REST, Spring Web Services, Spring Security, Retrieve POJOs as JSON, Exception Handling, API Design Practices, REST CRUD API with Hibernate: 
            This is where your Java program starts having conversations with other programs, sharing data, and instructions. Imagine having a universal translator that
            allows you to communicate with anyone, anywhere - that's APIs for you
